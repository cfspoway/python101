Your task is to use computer to randomly roll three dice at the same time and calculate the sum of the three numbers facing up. 
Then let computer roll 1,000,000 times. Count how many times the sum of three dice is greater or equal to 10. 
Hint: before trying 1,000,000 times, try a small number such as 100 first.
