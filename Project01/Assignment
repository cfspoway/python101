Project # 1: A football game
Week #1 assignment (due 2017-02-02 before class):
1. Find your team members. Each team has 1-3 members.
2. Read carefully the rules below. Come up with a plan and flow chart and sketch them on paper.
3. Get ready to present your plan and flow chart in next class on 2017-02-02.

Below are the detailed rules of this project:
1. Draw a football court
  . Two teams: name and score
  . Game statistics
  . lines: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0 yard lines
  . Current position of the ball
  . hints:
     - To print the nth letter out of a TeamName word: print(TeamName[n-1])
     - To print something on one line using multiple print commands: print('string1', end=''), print(' string2')

2. Punt
  . Roll a die between 1 and 6, 1 point represents 10 yards. That is where the offense starts

3. First down
  . Both teams roll dice three times and sum them up
  . Compare offense points and defense points:
    - If offense has a triple, move 30 yards
    - Else if defense has a triple, fumble. Switch side
    - Else if offense has a double, move 20 yards
    - Else if offense has more points than defense, move 10 yards
    - Else Fourth down

4. Fourth down: let user choose:
  . Go for it. 
    - Both teams roll 4th die and add it to previous three dice. 
    - If offence points >= defense points, success, offense moves 10 yards
    - Else switch side
  . Kick or field goal. 
    - Offense rolls a die and move 10 * point yards
    - If ball passes end zone, field goal is good
    - Else switch side

5. Score keeping
  . Whenver the ball enters the end zone, offense gets new score, then switch side
  . 3 point for field goal
  . 6 point for touch down
  . Touch down extra point: let user choose:
    - Automatic 1 point
    - 2 points: each team rolls one die. 
      * If offense point > defense point, 2 extra points
      * Else zero extra point
