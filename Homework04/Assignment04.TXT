2. Mortgage calculator:
. Ask user to input three numbers: the Loan amount in dollors, MortgageRate in percentage, and the number of Years to pay off
. Convert input strings to real numbers
. Do the calculation using following three formulas (note you need to make them work in Python):
  month = Years * 12
  rate = MortgageRate / 100 / 12
  MonthlyPayment = Loan[rate(1 + rate)**month]/[(1 + rate)**month - 1]
. Print out the MonthlyPayment
. To see if the program is correct, try a sample input: Loan=100000, MortgageRate = 3, Years = 30, and you should get a monthly payment around 421.60
. Ask your parents or friends to be the user of this little mortage calculator
