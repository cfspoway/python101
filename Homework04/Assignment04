2. Mortgage calculator:
. Ask user to input three numbers: the Loan amount in dollors, MortgageRate in percentage, and the number of Years to pay off
. Convert the three input strings to three real numbers. You may use variable names: Loan, MortgageRate, Years
. Do the calculation based on the three numbers, using following three formulas
  (note that you need to tweek the 3rd formula so that it can work in Python):
    month = Years * 12
    rate = MortgageRate / 100 / 12
    MonthlyPayment = Loan[rate(1 + rate)**month]/[(1 + rate)**month - 1]
. Print out the result (MonthlyPayment)
. To see if the program is correct, try a sample input: Loan = 100000, MortgageRate = 3, Years = 30, and you should get a MonthlyPayment around 421.60
. Ask your parents or friends to be the user of this little mortage calculator
