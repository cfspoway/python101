Homework assignment #7
. Please include you first name as part of the program file name
. Email your program to teacher. Due 11/30/2016 9pm
. No class next week. Happy Thanksgivings!

1. Sort three numbers from the largest to the smallest
. Ask user to input three numbers (a, b, c), convert them from string to real number
. Compare and sort all three numbers from the largest to the smallest
   - Try to draw a flow chart before writing the code, but you do not need to submit the flow chart
. Output all three numbers from the largest to the smallest
. To test your program, try to pass all following test cases:
   - Input: 1, 2, 3. expected Output: 3, 2, 1
   - Input: 2, 1, 3. expected Output: 3, 2, 1
   - Input: 1, 3, 2. expected Output: 3, 2, 1
   - Input: 3, 2, 1. expected Output: 3, 2, 1
   - Input: 2, 3, 1. expected Output: 3, 2, 1
   - Input: 3, 1, 2. expected Output: 3, 2, 1
   - Input: 1, 1, 2. expected Output: 2, 1, 1
   - Input: 1, 2, 1. expected Output: 2, 1, 1
   - Input: 2, 1, 1. expected Output: 2, 1, 1
   - Input: 1, 1, 1. expected Output: 1, 1, 1

2. Leap year
. Ask user to input a year number and convert it to integer number
. Check the input year number is positive
. Check if the input year number is a leap year by following rules:
   - Year can be divided by 4 (hint: year % 4 == 0)
   - If the year can also be divided by 100, it must also can be divided by 400
. If the input year number satisfies all above rules, print out that it is a leap year. Otherwise, print out it is not a leap year.
. To test your program, try to pass all following test cases:
   - Input: 2016. expected output: 2016 is a leap year
   - Input: 2017. expected output: 2017 is not a leap year
   - Input: 1900. expected output: 1900 is not a leap year
   - Input: 2000. expected output: 2000 is a leap year
