1. Re-do the area of triangle
Below (part 2) is an old homework we did to calculate the area of a triangle:
https://github.com/cfspoway/python101/blob/master/Homework03/Homework03.py
But when we input negative number or random number as edge length, it may not be valid for a real triangle. So we want to add some checking of the input.
Here is the new assignment:
. Take the old homework as the starting point
. Get three inputs from the user, and convert them to real numbers: a, b, and c, just as in the old homework.
. Check that all input numbers are positive. 
. Check that the addition of any two inputs is less than the third input. For example, (a + b) < c.
. If any of the above checks fail, print out an alarm message and quit the program.
. If input numbers pass all the above checks, do the calculation of triangle area and print out the result, just as in the old homework.
. To check that your program is correct, try the following test cases:
   - input: 2, -1, 2, output: edge length must be positive
   - input: 1, 2, 5, output: input is not valid for a triangle
   - input: 2, 2, 3, output: The area of this triangle is: 1.98

2. Compare three numbers
. Ask user to input three numbers (a, b, c), convert them from string to real number
. Compare all three numbers, and find the largest number
. Print out the largest number
. When all three numbers are equal, print out 'All three numbers are equal'
. Bonus point: when there are two equal largest numbers, for example a and b are equal and larger than c, print out 'There are two largest numbers a and b'
